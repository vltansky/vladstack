# Fix PR

## Step 0: Resolve PR & Ensure Correct Branch

### 0a. Determine Target PR

Check if the user mentioned a PR number or URL in the conversation.

If yes — use that:
```bash
PR_NUM=$(gh pr view <number-or-url> --json number --jq .number)
PR_BRANCH=$(gh pr view <number-or-url> --json headRefName --jq .headRefName)
```

If no — use the current branch's PR:
```bash
PR_NUM=$(gh pr view --json number --jq .number)
PR_BRANCH=$(gh pr view --json headRefName --jq .headRefName)
```

If `gh pr view` fails (no PR found): tell user "No PR found" and stop.

```bash
REPO=$(gh repo view --json nameWithOwner --jq .nameWithOwner)
```

### 0b. Check Current Branch

```bash
CURRENT_BRANCH=$(git branch --show-current)
```

If `CURRENT_BRANCH` equals `PR_BRANCH` — proceed to Step 1.

### 0c. Handle Branch Mismatch

Check for uncommitted changes:
```bash
git status --porcelain
```

**If uncommitted changes exist:** Ask the user with the file list. Options:
- **Stash & switch** — `git stash --include-untracked --message "fix-pr: auto-stash from $CURRENT_BRANCH"`, then checkout
- **Switch without stashing** — Checkout directly (changes carry over if no conflicts)
- **Cancel** — Stop, keep current branch

**If clean:** Ask the user:
- "You're on `$CURRENT_BRANCH` but PR #$PR_NUM is on `$PR_BRANCH`. Switch branch?"
- Options: **Switch** / **Stay**

If switching:
```bash
git checkout $PR_BRANCH && git pull
```

## Step 1: Check Build Status

```bash
SHA=$(gh pr view $PR_NUM --json commits --jq '.commits[-1].oid')
BUILD_STATE=$(gh api repos/$REPO/commits/$SHA/status --jq '.state')
echo "Build: $BUILD_STATE"
```

Also check for CI status via checks API:
```bash
gh pr checks $PR_NUM
```

| Build Status | Action |
|--------------|--------|
| **success** | Proceed to Step 2 |
| **failure** | Analyze failure (Step 1a), then ask user |
| **pending** | Tell user: "Build still running. Proceed with comments or wait?" |
| **No status** | Proceed to Step 2 |

### If Build Failed

#### Step 1a: Analyze the Failure

```bash
# Check for CI bot comments with build output
gh pr view $PR_NUM --json comments --jq '.comments[-1].body' | head -50
```

1. **Identify the error** — parse for test failures, type errors, lint errors, build errors.
2. **Check if caused by this PR:**
   ```bash
   gh pr view $PR_NUM --json files --jq '.files[].path'
   ```

| Error Location | Action |
|----------------|--------|
| File in PR diff | Fix it — it's your change |
| File NOT in PR diff | Likely flaky/external — explain to user |

**If caused by PR:** Read the failing file, fix, commit: `fix: [description]`

**If external:** Present options to user:
- Post explanation as PR comment
- Re-run the build (if CI supports re-trigger comments)
- Skip and proceed with PR comments

## Step 2: Fetch Comments

```bash
# General PR comments
gh pr view $PR_NUM --json comments --jq '.comments[] | {id, body, author: .author.login}'

# Inline code review comments
gh api repos/$REPO/pulls/$PR_NUM/comments --jq '.[] | {id, body, author: .user.login, path, line}'
```

If no comments: "No PR comments to address."

## Step 3: Create TODO List

One TODO per comment. Include file:line for inline comments.

## Step 4: For Each Comment

### 4a. Evaluate

Is this valid feedback?
- Does it improve correctness or quality?
- Is it based on accurate understanding of the code?

### 4b. Decide Action

| Confidence | Action |
|------------|--------|
| **High (agree)** | Implement the fix |
| **Low (disagree/unsure)** | Ask the user before implementing |

For low confidence, explain your concern then ask:
- "The reviewer suggested X, but [concern]. What should we do?"
- Options: "Skip and reply why" / "Implement it anyway"

### 4c. Draft Reply & Get Approval

Show the comment and your draft reply:

```
> [original comment text]

Draft reply: [your draft reply]

Why: [brief reasoning]

After posting: resolve this review thread?
```

Options: "Post reply and resolve" / "Post reply only" / "Edit reply first"

### 4d. Post Reply (after approval only)

```bash
# Reply to inline review comment
gh api repos/$REPO/pulls/$PR_NUM/comments/$COMMENT_ID/replies \
  -f body="<reply>"

# Reply to general PR comment
gh pr comment $PR_NUM --body "<reply>" --reply-to $COMMENT_ID
```

### 4e. Resolve Thread (inline review comments only, after approval)

Resolve via GraphQL — find the review thread containing this comment, then resolve it:

```bash
OWNER=$(echo "$REPO" | cut -d/ -f1)
NAME=$(echo "$REPO" | cut -d/ -f2)

THREADS_JSON=$(gh api graphql -f query='
query($owner:String!,$name:String!,$pr:Int!) {
  repository(owner:$owner,name:$name) {
    pullRequest(number:$pr) {
      reviewThreads(first:100) {
        nodes { id isResolved comments(first:50) { nodes { databaseId } } }
      }
    }
  }
}' -f owner="$OWNER" -f name="$NAME" -f pr="$PR_NUM")

THREAD_ID=$(echo "$THREADS_JSON" | jq -r --argjson cid "$COMMENT_ID" '
  .data.repository.pullRequest.reviewThreads.nodes[]
  | select(.isResolved == false)
  | select([.comments.nodes[].databaseId] | contains([$cid]))
  | .id
' | head -1)

if [ -n "$THREAD_ID" ]; then
  gh api graphql -f query='mutation($id:ID!){ resolveReviewThread(input:{threadId:$id}) { thread { isResolved } } }' -f id="$THREAD_ID"
fi
```

If `THREAD_ID` is empty: tell user the reply was posted and they can resolve manually in the PR UI.

Mark TODO complete, move to next comment.

## Critical Rules

1. **Never post or resolve without explicit approval** — show draft first, wait for confirmation
2. **Always reply to the specific comment** — use replies API, not a new top-level comment
3. **Never post a general PR comment** when addressing inline review comments (stay on-thread)
4. **Default: reply + resolve** for inline threads after user approves (unless they opt out)

## Summary

| Scenario | Response |
|----------|----------|
| No comments | "No PR comments to address." |
| All addressed | "All done! Addressed X comments." |
| Some skipped | "Addressed X comments, skipped Y. Let me know if you want to revisit." |

## Workflow

**Prev:** `/ship-it` (PR created, reviewers left comments)
**Next:** `/ship-it` (re-push after fixes) | `/roast-my-code` (self-review before re-push) | done
